# Learn ES6 with test

*We are studying ECMAScript 6 but, instead of writing notes on a notepad (that will be lost and forgotten), we decided to write understandable tests!*

## Clone, test... and learn! 

All tests are included in **test/** folder.
	
To test:

	git clone https://github.com/D-Mobilelab/learn-es6-with-tests.git learn-es6
	cd learn-es6
	npm install
	bower install
	gulp test
